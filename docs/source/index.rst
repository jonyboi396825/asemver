Welcome to asemver's documentation!
===================================

This is an implementation of semantic versioning in Python. 
This will not be a standalone package on PyPI because there is 
already `another implementation <https://pypi.org/project/semver/>`_ 
of semantic versioning.

If anything, this package will only be used as a component of
a bigger project in a git submodule or installed using git.

The documentation is not going to be on readthedocs or GitHub
Pages and is only here for testing and clarity reasons.
