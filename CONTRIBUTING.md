# Contributing

This package is likely not going be be a standalone one, so I am not going to add any new features to this. This means that asemver is not going to look at any pull requests for features. If I use this package in a bigger project, features (both PRs and issues) should be added to the repository of the bigger project, because I will likely not look at this project. Bug reports as issues will be accepted here, but I prefer that those issues be submitted in the repository of the bigger project as well.
